# [cappig.dev](https://cappig.dev/)

This is my new blog. The old [neocities page](https://cappig.neocities.org/) can be found on the `old` branch.

To generate the html for the site run `python generate.py`.

To deploy the site host `./site` at `/` and `./static` at `/static`. Domains should first try to locate their respective `.html` file, eg. `/foo -> ./site/foo.html`. The provided `Caddyfile` is already configured to do this.
