Hello I'm Matej, I go by Cappig online. I'm a programmer and I make random stuff sometimes. I like C, python, osdev/low level programming, playing Doom, philosophy and chilling. Currently I'm a computer science undergrad at the [University of Zagreb](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/studies/bachelor/computing).

This is my personal blog and project repository. I might post some more stuff on here in the near future.

This site is hosted on the remnants of an old Asus laptop that sits bellow my table. It's generated from markdown sources using jinja html templates and some simple python code.

You can find me and my code on [Github](https://github.com/cappig). You can e-mail me at <matt@cappig.dev>.
