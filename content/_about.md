Hello, I'm Matej. I go by Cappig online. I'm a programmer, and I make random stuff sometimes. I like C, Python, OSdev / low-level programming, playing Doom, philosophy, and chilling. Currently, I'm a computer science undergrad at the [University of Zagreb](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/studies/bachelor/computing).

This is my personal blog and project repository. I might post more stuff here in the near future.

This site is hosted on the remnants of an old Asus laptop that sits below my table. It's generated from Markdown sources using Jinja HTML templates and some simple Python code.

You can find me and my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cappig). You can email me at <matt@cappig.dev>.
