I'm Matej sometimes known online as Cappig. I'm a programmer and I make random stuff sometimes. This is my personal blog/project repository. I'll post all sorts of stuff here.
I like C, python, osdev and low level programming, playing Doom, philosophy, and chilling ^_^.

Read more [about me](/about), or read some of my [blog posts](/blog). You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/cappig).
